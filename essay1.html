      <p>Actually, stress is a very necessary and useful life mechanism for our body. It is an indispensable process that cannot be avoided. However, when we say this, many people may think that it sounds contradictory.

Let's explain:

In nature, under primitive conditions, just like other animals, when faced with dangerous situations, humans had only two options: to fight or to flee. The danger they were in at that time could be dealt with either by fighting or running away. Therefore, the survival effort was carried out through these two options.

During these moments of stress, several things happen in the body:

In response to perceived fear, the brain activates mechanisms that send stimulating signals to the adrenal glands. The stimulation of these glands causes them to secrete the hormone 'cortisol' which promotes the release of glucose into the bloodstream from the glycogen stores in the lungs. Glucose, or sugar, is a great form of energy for the body, and the adaptive mechanism of its release into the bloodstream at a moment when 'fight or flight' is needed is excellent-this has helped humankind in their survival through the ages.

Besides cortisol, the adrenal glands also manufacture 'adrenaline' and 'noradrenaline.' Adrenaline increases the pumping ability of the heart and also quickens its rhythm. Normally, the heart pumps about 5 liters of blood, but under the influence of adrenaline, this amount can increase to 12-15 liters.

On the other hand, noradrenaline constricts the blood vessels, especially those supplying the blood to the digestive system; after all, it is not needed in these moments. It could also be the explanation for appetite and digestion being upset by stress. As all the blood vessels constrict and the blood pressure goes up, blood starts getting routed to the places it is most needed: the brain and the muscles. This in turn amplifies performance. The rate of breathing also increases to take in more oxygen, and the pupils widen to let in more light to improve the quality of vision.

In a nutshell, under stress,

Blood sugar rises, so energy does, too. Blood circulation and pressure accelerate: blood flows more to the brain and muscles. In this way, physical performance can be raised 2 to 3 times higher. Natural doping ????. This is heritage from our ancestors when people survived dangers either by fighting or fleeing.

Obviously, in life-or-death situations, all those physiological reactions become useful and self-preserving.

However, the point is that stress-so useful in short bursts-becomes harmful if it is chronic, that is, long-term. Under conditions of modernity, taking the feeling of constant danger and the necessity to 'fight or flee' is making stress a permanent state.

When stress becomes permanent, the helpful mechanisms of the body that were once so vital in the short term now have destructive and disrupting effects over the long term. This way, the conditions for various diseases to emerge are created.

What kind of diseases can arise?

The constant high levels of cortisol, which raise blood sugar, can lead to the development of diabetes. Excess cortisol also puts pressure on the immune system, increasing the risk of cancer and infectious diseases. Sometimes, a weakened immune system can lead to 'autoimmune diseases,' where the immune system attacks the body's organs, as seen in rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Covid-19, etc.

The disturbance in heart rhythm is created by the constant secretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline, and hypertension then becomes a chronic disease. Both the vasoconstriction (the narrowing of blood vessels) and diabetes also affect the strength of blood vessels. This risky process called atherosclerosis results in blockage of blood vessels to create brain and kidney diseases including heart attack, paralysis, and dementia.

Stress hormones, in turn, disrupt the quality of sleep and give birth to sleep disorders such as insomnia and disturbed sleeping patterns. It might further cause a person to wake up with fatigue, which has other further complications arising, such as poor performance and nervous breakdowns in doing daily chores.

If unprevented by some preventive measure, this can be a cycle which is, once it reaches its full potential, very difficult to overcome.

As you can see, the negative effects of chronic stress are far-reaching and affect many areas of our body. Therefore, it is important to step away from those factors that continuously provoke stress. Above all, individuals need to understand themselves, and by adopting stress-relieving activities and habits, they can relax and welcome positive, hopeful energy.

But how can we prevent stress from becoming chronic?

Human biology programmed in the past to react with 'fight or flee' finds it difficult to adjust to the socio-political factors of modern life. These factors include:

Apprehensions related to monthly income, Loss of job and unemployment and fear of losing job, Unpaid loans and its fear of failure.

All of them are sources of stress that make us feel they'll never be over. Fighting against them doesn't seem to convince us, because 24 hours are not enough to erase those worries from daily life. In addition, some of them may have been socially traumatized during their childhood years in different ways.

This chronic stress of having to create a socially integrated life has become an overwhelming challenge for human biology. It would now appear that this biology, insufficiently prepared for such a task, has to groan under the burden of its inability to devise remedies for such ensuing diseases.

Maybe it is time to look for a way out of this 'pandemic' of cortisol by working all together. In devising different approaches, both psychological and socio-political, we may find tools that could be useful in dealing with this situation.
