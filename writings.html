       <p>This essay explores the biological mechanisms of stress, emphasizing its evolutionary role in human survival. It explains how stress triggers physiological responses, such as the release of hormones like cortisol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline, which prepare the body for "fight or flight." While these processes are beneficial in the short term, the essay highlights the dangers of chronic stress, including its potential to cause various health issues like diabetes, heart disease, and autoimmune disorders. The piece also addresses the modern challenges that contribute to chronic stress and discusses strategies for managing it to avoid long-term health consequences.</p>
