            <h2>Prion</h2>
            <p>Prions are among the most mysterious and dangerous agents known to science. Unlike any other infectious organism, prions have no DNA or RNA. They are not viruses, bacteria, or fungi. A prion is simply a misfolded protein, yet it has the power to destroy one of the most complex organs in the body — the brain.</p>

            <p>Normally, the PrP protein found in our bodies is harmless and helps nerve cells function. However, when a prion appears, it changes the shape of the normal PrP proteins, turning them into more prions. This creates a chain reaction, where each abnormal protein causes others to misfold, leading to spongy holes in the brain tissue. Because of this, prion diseases are called spongiform encephalopathies.</p>

            <p>In humans, the most well-known prion disease is Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD). In animals, they cause diseases such as mad cow disease (BSE) and scrapie in sheep.</p>

            <p>What makes prions truly fascinating is their resistance — they can survive heat, radiation, and disinfectants that would normally destroy other infectious agents. In many cases, it’s almost impossible to eliminate them completely.</p>

            <h2>The Most Well-Known Prion Diseases</h2>

            <h3>1. Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease (CJD) – In Humans</h3>
            <p>This is the most common prion disease in humans. It causes slow but deadly brain degeneration. Symptoms include memory loss, loss of balance, personality changes, and muscle stiffness.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sporadic CJD:</strong> Appears spontaneously (the most common form).</li>
                <li><strong>Familial CJD:</strong> Inherited through a genetic mutation.</li>
                <li><strong>Variant CJD (vCJD):</strong> Can occur after eating meat from cows infected with mad cow disease (BSE).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>CJD usually progresses rapidly and, unfortunately, has no cure.</p>

            <h3>2. Mad Cow Disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy – BSE) – In Cows</h3>
            <p>This disease first appeared in the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Cows became infected after eating animal feed contaminated with prions.</p>
            <p>Infected cows develop spongy holes in their brains, causing them to act confused, uncoordinated, and aggressive — which is why it’s called “mad cow disease.” Humans who eat meat from infected cows can develop variant CJD (vCJD).</p>

            <h3>3. Scrapie – In Sheep</h3>
            <p>Scrapie is a prion disease known for centuries. It damages the brain and spinal cord of sheep. One of the most unusual symptoms is that sheep rub their bodies against walls or fences, which is why it’s called “scrapie.”</p>
            <p>Interestingly, scrapie does not infect humans, but it has helped scientists understand diseases like BSE and CJD.</p>

            <p><strong>💡 Interesting Fact:</strong> Some scientists describe prions as “immortal proteins” because they can survive in nature for many years without breaking down. This makes them both fascinating and terrifying.</p>

            <h2>Kuru Disease – The Prion Disease Linked to Cannibalism</h2>
            <p>Kuru is a rare but historically important prion disease found in humans. It was discovered in the mid-1900s among the Fore tribe in Papua New Guinea.</p>
            <p>In this tribe, people practiced ritual cannibalism — during funeral ceremonies, they ate the bodies of their deceased relatives to show love and respect. Women and children, who often ate the brain tissue, unknowingly consumed infectious prion proteins. Once inside the body, these prions slowly destroyed brain tissue.</p>
            <p>The word “Kuru” means “to shake” in the Fore language, referring to the uncontrollable trembling that patients developed.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Lose the ability to walk or stand</li>
                <li>Experience sudden fits of laughter or crying</li>
                <li>Eventually lose control of speech and movement</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Sadly, the disease was always fatal. After the practice of cannibalism was banned, Kuru almost completely disappeared.</p>

            <p><strong>💡 Interesting Fact:</strong> The study of Kuru helped scientists understand how prion diseases work, leading to major discoveries about Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) and mad cow disease (BSE).</p>

            <h3>-- GOOGLE ANSWER</h3>
            <p><strong>Kuru (Disease)</strong><br>
            <em>What it is:</em> An infectious, neurological, and degenerative disease caused by abnormal proteins called prions.<br>
            <em>Causes:</em> It was transmitted to humans through the funerary cannibalism tradition practiced by the Fore tribe in Papua New Guinea.<br>
            <em>Symptoms:</em><br>
            First stage: Body tremors (the word “kuru” comes from this symptom), difficulty walking, and stuttering while speaking.<br>
            Second stage: Inability to walk without support, severe trembling, muscle loss, and uncontrollable laughter (“laughing disease”).<br>
            Third stage: Inability to sit, loss of speech, loss of bladder control, and unresponsiveness.<br>
            <em>Final stage:</em> Kuru disease is considered an extinct illness, as the last known patient died in 2005.</p>

            <h3>-- İSTANBUL UNIVERSITY</h3>
            <p><strong>Kuru Disease</strong><br>
            With the advancement of modern technology, the number of unknown and untreatable diseases has significantly decreased. However, there are still some diseases that remain.</p>
